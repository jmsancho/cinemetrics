Cinemetrics
===========

This code is part of http://cinemetrics.fredericbrodbeck.de/

Cinemetrics is about measuring and visualizing movie data, in order to reveal the characteristics of films and to create a visual "fingerprint" for them. Information such as the editing structure, color, speech or motion are extracted, analyzed and transformed into graphic representations so that movies can be seen as a whole and easily interpreted or compared side by side.

~~At the moment these tools lack proper documentation, sorry.~~ Expanding documentation.

# Requirements
* Vagrant
    * Fingers crossed, that's all you should need! The goal of this fork is to wrap all the dependencies needed for cinemetrics into a reusable vagrantfile.
 
# Installation
* Clone the repo to your local machine. 
* vagrant up
* Open an issue if that doesn't work
